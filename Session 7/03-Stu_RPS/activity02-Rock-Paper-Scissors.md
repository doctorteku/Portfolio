## W2D2 - Activity 02: Making Rock, Paper, Scissors

* During this part of the activity, you will work on coding a rock, paper, scissors game that will run within a webpage using JavaScript event listeners and conditionals.

* **Instructions:**

    * Begin the process of coding out the rock-paper-scissors game. Remember the basic steps to the game...

        1. User chooses r, p, or s on keyboard representing rock, paper, or scissors.

        2. Computer chooses a random value in a list of r, p, or s.

        3. We determine if the user wins or not.

            * If user picks rock and if computer picks scissors then user wins.

            * If user picks rock and if computer picks paper then user loses.

            * If user picks scissors and if computer picks rock then user loses.

            * If user picks scissors and if computer picks paper then user wins.

            * If user picks paper and if computer picks rock then user wins.

            * If user picks paper and if computer picks scissors then user loses.

            * If user picks the same as computer then they tie.

        4. We then add to their score.

            * If user wins then we add one to their wins.

            * If user loses then we add one to their losses.

            * If user ties then we add one to their ties.

        5. The user then presses r, p, or s to play again.

    * Do as much as you can on your own (but don't be afraid to ask for help if you feel you are stuck)!

* **Note**: Don’t let yourself get frustrated - this is a very challenging assignment! You might not know where to start and in fact, we haven’t shown you _EVERYTHING_ you need just yet (although we've shown you most of it). That’s okay!! Part of learning a new language like programming is figuring things out on your own through trial and error. We promise that this will make sense by the end!
