## W2D2 - Activity 01: Listening For Specific Keys

* In this activity, you will be creating code that listens for specific keys to be pressed. If none of the keys they are interested in are pressed, then nothing should occur. If one of the keys they ARE interested in are pressed, then some alert should be sent to the user.

* **Instructions:**

    * Create a new HTML page that tells the user to click either the "a", "b", "c", or "d" buttons.

    * Now write some JavaScript code that listens for these buttons to be pressed. If one of the buttons mentioned above is pressed then an alert saysing "YOU PRESSED A GOOD BUTTON" should be posted. Otherwise nothing should occur.

    * Next, reorganize your code a little so that an alert reading "WRONG CHOICE! TRY AGAIN!" is posted whenever a button other than those mentioned above is clicked.

    * Reorganize your code once more so that the page now keeps track of how many correct key presses were made in a row. This should include rewriting your correct choice prompt so that it tells the user how many times they have hit the right button in a row. Also, make certain to reset the count whenever an incorrect choice is made.
